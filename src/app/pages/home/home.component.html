  Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science-fiction sitcom created by
  Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming
  block Adult Swim. It is distributed internationally by Warner Bros. Television
  Distribution. The series follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical
  mad scientist, and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who
  split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures that
  take place across an infinite number of realities, often traveling to other
  planets and dimensions through portals and on Rick's flying saucer. The
  general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two conflicting scenarios:
  domestic family drama, and a misanthropic grandfather dragging his grandson
  into hijinks.
